Circuit Breakers

A circuit breaker is an electrical switch that automatically opens to interrupt current flow when an overcurrent condition is detected. Unlike fuses, circuit breakers can be reset after being triggered, making them reusable. Circuit breakers come in different types, including molded case circuit breakers (MCCBs), air circuit breakers (ACBs), and smart circuit breakers, among others.

Fuses

A fuse is a thin conductor designed to melt and break the circuit when excessive current flows through it. Fuses are one-time-use devices and must be replaced after they have blown. Fuses are commonly used in low-voltage applications to protect electrical appliances, systems, and devices.
