**Nonvolatile SRAM Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025**

Nonvolatile SRAM (nvSRAM) is a memory technology that combines the fast access speeds of static RAM (SRAM) with the non-volatile characteristics of flash memory. This means nvSRAM can retain data even in the absence of power, unlike traditional SRAM, which requires continuous power to maintain its contents. As a battery-free alternative, nvSRAM eliminates the need for battery-backed SRAM, making it a preferred choice in applications requiring high reliability and data retention, such as aerospace, networking, and medical devices.
