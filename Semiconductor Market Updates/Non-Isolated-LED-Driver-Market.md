**Non-Isolated LED Driver Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025**

Non-Isolated LED Drivers are electrical devices that directly connect the load terminal to the input terminal without using a transformer to step down the voltage. These drivers allow the high voltage from the alternating current (AC) source to be supplied directly to the load terminal, ensuring efficient operation and compact design. Non-isolated drivers are frequently used in applications requiring cost-effective and space-saving solutions, such as commercial LED lighting and home appliances.
