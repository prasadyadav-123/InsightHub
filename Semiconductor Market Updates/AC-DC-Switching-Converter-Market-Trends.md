Types of AC-DC Switching Converters

1. Buck Converter

A buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that steps down the input voltage to a lower, regulated output voltage. While its primary function is for DC-DC conversion, it can be used in AC-DC systems to reduce high AC voltages to more manageable DC levels for devices like chargers and LED drivers.

2. Boost Converter

In contrast to the buck converter, a boost converter increases the input voltage to a higher output voltage. These converters are often used in applications where the input voltage needs to be increased, such as in solar power systems and electric vehicles.

3. Buck-Boost Converter

The buck-boost converter combines the functions of both the buck and boost converters, allowing the input voltage to be either increased or decreased. These converters are used in applications where the input voltage fluctuates significantly.

4. Flyback Converter

A flyback converter is a type of isolated AC-DC converter used in low to medium-power applications. It is particularly useful in power supplies for TVs, computers, and low-voltage systems, providing electrical isolation between the input and output.
