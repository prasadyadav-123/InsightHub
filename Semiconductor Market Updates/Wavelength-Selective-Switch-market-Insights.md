**Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024**

The Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) market revolves around a key optical communication component widely utilized in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. WSS dynamically routes, blocks, or attenuates individual wavelengths within a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) network. These devices are integral to modern reconfigurable agile optical networks, enabling efficient and flexible signal routing for high-capacity telecommunications.

WSS systems operate using a common input port and multiple output ports. Each wavelength from the common port is switched independently to specific output ports, ensuring dynamic allocation and power equalization. With mechanisms for variable attenuation, WSS optimizes channel power, ensuring robust network performance.
