**Network Surveillance Cameras Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025**

Network Surveillance Cameras, also referred to as IP Cameras, are advanced digital video cameras widely utilized for surveillance purposes. Unlike traditional analog CCTV cameras, IP cameras can transmit and receive data over a computer network or the Internet. Although similar in some respects to webcams, the term "IP Cameras" or "netcams" is typically reserved for devices designed specifically for surveillance.

These cameras integrate sophisticated functionalities, including high-resolution imaging, remote monitoring, and compatibility with advanced analytics. The growing adoption of IP cameras in various sectors underscores their pivotal role in enhancing security and operational efficiency.
