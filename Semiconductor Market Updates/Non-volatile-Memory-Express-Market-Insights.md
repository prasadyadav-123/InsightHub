**Non-volatile Memory Express (NVM) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025**

Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a logical device interface specification designed specifically for non-volatile storage media, such as solid-state drives (SSDs). Unlike traditional storage protocols like SATA or SAS, NVMe leverages the high-speed PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) bus to deliver unmatched performance. With its ability to support deep parallelism through queues, NVMe can manage up to 64,000 commands in a single queue and handle 64,000 queues simultaneously. This results in significantly reduced latency, higher input/output operations per second (IOPS), and improved energy efficiency, making it a game-changer in the storage industry.
