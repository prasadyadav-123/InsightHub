**Non-common Path Interferometer Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025**

A Non-common optical path interferometer is a precision measurement device used to detect minute changes in optical path lengths by measuring the interference between two beams of light that travel along different paths. It operates on the principle of wave superposition, where the light waves combine to produce interference fringes that can be analyzed to derive physical quantities such as surface profiles, displacements, and distance measurements.

This interferometer differs from conventional interferometers by not requiring both beams to travel the same optical path. Instead, the beams are directed through separate optical paths, which allows the interferometer to be used for a wide range of measurements, including surface topography and dimensional analysis. The ability to detect slight deformations or displacements in the object being tested through the changes in the interference pattern makes it an indispensable tool for high-precision measurements in various scientific and industrial applications.
